          <h3>NO WARRANTY</h3>

            INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
            TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties, so the
            above may not apply to you.</p>
          <h3>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
          <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL ROYALTY, ITS RELATED COMPANIES, AND EACH SUCH COMPANY’S DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES
            AND AGENTS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES
            ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR ACCESS, USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITE, ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED
            BY THE SITE OR ANY TRANSACTION ENTERED INTO THROUGH THE SITE OR MOBILE APP.</p>
          <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain damages, so the above may not apply to you. If any
            authority holds any portion of this section to be unenforceable, then liability will be limited to the
            fullest extent permitted by applicable law.</p>
          <h3>INDEMNITY</h3>
          <p>You agree to indemnify and hold Royalty and its related companies and each of their respective directors,
            officers, employees and agents harmless from and against any third-party claim or cause of action, including
            reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, arising, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, out of your
            violation of any law or the rights of any person.</p>
          <h3>BINDING ARBITRATION</h3>
          <p>You agree that any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Site or use of the Site or these
            Terms, other than claims relating to infringement of copyright or other intellectual property, may only be
            settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the Paragraph or alternatively, you may assert your claims
            in small claims court if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances
            only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. The arbitration must be held in a location
            determined by the arbitrator as set forth herein (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for
            you), or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties, in accordance with the
            applicable procedural rules set forth in the then prevailing Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures
            of JAMS (“JAMS Rules and Procedures”), and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be
            entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The JAMS Rules and Procedures are available at
            www.jamsadr.com or by calling (800) 352-5267. The arbitrator must be selected pursuant to the JAMS Rules and
            Procedures. The arbitrator shall apply Nevada law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable
            statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law. If you initiate arbitration
            against Royalty, you will not be responsible for professional fees for the arbitrator’s services or any
            other JAMS fees. If You are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be cost-prohibitive or
            greater than the costs of litigation, Royalty will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection
            with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being
            cost-prohibitive or more expensive than the cost of litigation. If any part of this arbitration provision is
            deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal (other than that claims will not be arbitrated on a class or
            representative basis), or otherwise conflicts with the rules and procedures established by JAMS, then the
            balance of this arbitration provision remains in effect and must be construed in accordance with its terms
            as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however,
            the portion that is deemed invalid, unenforceable or illegal is that claims will not be arbitrated on a
            class or representative basis, then the entirety of this arbitration provision is null and void, and neither
            You nor Royalty is entitled to arbitrate their dispute. THE ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES PURSUANT TO THIS
            PARAGRAPH MUST BE IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS
            OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN THE CLAIMS OF OTHER PERSONS OR
            PARTIES WHO MAY BE SIMILARLY SITUATED.</p>
          <p>BY AGREEING TO THE ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES AS SET FORTH HEREIN, YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT
            TO A JURY TRIAL AND LIMITING YOUR RIGHT TO APPEAL AND YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHTS TO
            MAINTAIN OTHER AVAILABLE RESOLUTION PROCESSES, SUCH AS A COURT ACTION.</p>
          <h3>DISPUTES</h3>
          <p>These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Nevada, United
            States of America, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any action to enforce these Terms of
            Use regarding a claim not subject to binding arbitration must be brought in the federal court or the state
            courts located in Clark County, Nevada. By using the Site, you consent to the jurisdiction and venue of
            these courts. Except where prohibited, you agree that any and all disputes, claims and causes of action
            directly or indirectly arising out of the Site must be resolved individually, without resort to any form of
            class action. Any claim or cause of action you may have with respect to the Site must be commenced within
            one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises, regardless of any law to the contrary.</p>
          <h3>GENERAL</h3>
          <p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision must be
            construed consistent with applicable law, and the remaining provisions must be enforced. Headings are for
            reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe or describe the scope of such section. Our
            failure to enforce any provision of these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of that or any other
            provision. These Terms of Use set forth the entire agreement between you and Royalty in connection with your
            use of the Site.</p>
